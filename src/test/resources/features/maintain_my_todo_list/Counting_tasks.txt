Feature: Counting items left

  To equitably distribute household chores among family members
  like a forgetful person
  I want to be able to record the pending tasks of each person

  Scenario: the amount of pending tasks showing properly
    Given that Jane has a todo list containing Buy some milk, Walk the dog
    And she has completed the task called 'Walk the dog'
    When she filters her list to show only Completed tasks
    Then her todo list should show 1 item left

  Scenario: the amount of pending tasks of more than one person showing properly
    Given that James has a todo list containing Buy some milk, Walk the dog
    And that Jill has a todo list containing Buy some milk, Buy some cheese
    When she adds 'Buy some cereal' to her list
    Then Jill's todo list should show 3 items left
    And James's todo list should show 2 items left

  Scenario: the amount of pending tasks when a person completes the tasks
    Given that James has an empty todo list
    And he adds 'Buy some milk' to his list
    And that Jill has a todo list containing Buy some milk, Buy some cheese
    When she adds 'Buy some cereal' to her list
    And he completes the task called 'Buy some milk'
    Then Jill's todo list should show 3 items left
    And James's todo list should show 0 items left
